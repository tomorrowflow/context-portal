# Context Portal MCP Release Notes

<br>

## Version 0.2.11 - Cursor Initialization Hotfix

This release addresses a critical bug that caused `NameError: name 'cursor' is not defined` during database operations.

**Key Fix:**

- **Cursor Initialization Fix:** Corrected `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to ensure the `cursor` variable is always initialized before use within database functions. This resolves the `NameError` and ensures robust database interactions.

**Impact:**

This is a critical fix for server stability, ensuring all database operations function correctly.

<br>

## Version 0.2.10 - Pydantic Model Hotfix

This release addresses a critical bug that caused MCP connection failures on Windows due to improper path escaping in the generated tool schema.

**Key Fix:**

- **Pydantic Model Default Fix:** Modified `src/context_portal_mcp/db/models.py` to add `default=None` to optional path arguments in the `ExportConportToMarkdownArgs` and `ImportMarkdownToConportArgs` models. This prevents Pydantic from generating default path values that contain unescaped backslashes on Windows, resolving the `SyntaxError: Bad escaped character in JSON` error during server startup.

**Impact:**

This is a critical fix for Windows users, ensuring the ConPort MCP server can start and run reliably.

<br>

## Version 0.2.9 - Path Escaping Hotfix

This release addresses a critical bug that caused MCP connection failures on Windows due to improper path escaping.

**Key Fix:**

- **JSON Escape Character Fix:** Modified `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to use `.as_posix()` when constructing file paths for Alembic. This ensures that all paths use forward slashes, preventing `SyntaxError: Bad escaped character in JSON` errors when the server communicates with the client on Windows.

**Impact:**

This is a critical fix for Windows users, ensuring the ConPort MCP server can start and run reliably.

## Version 0.2.8 - Alembic, Encoding, and Usability Enhancements

This release introduces several key improvements, including a fix for Alembic migrations, enhanced UTF-8 encoding for file operations, and a streamlined installation process.

**Key Fixes & Enhancements:**

- **Alembic Migration Fix:** Resolved a bug that caused import failures for `system_patterns.md` due to a missing `timestamp` column in the database schema. A new Alembic migration script has been added to correctly add this column, ensuring data integrity and successful imports.
- **UTF-8 Encoding:** All file read/write operations during data import and export now explicitly use `encoding="utf-8"`. This prevents encoding errors and ensures cross-platform compatibility.
- **Streamlined Installation:** The `README.md` has been updated to feature `uvx` as the primary and recommended method for running the ConPort server. This simplifies the setup process for new users. A special thanks to contributor [elasticdotventures](https://github.com/elasticdotventures) for their work on the `uvx` configuration.
- **Automated Alembic Provisioning:** The ConPort server now automatically ensures that the necessary `alembic.ini` and `alembic/` directory are present in the workspace root at startup, copying them from internal templates if they are missing.
- **Runtime Error Fix:** Corrected an `IndentationError` in `main.py` that occurred during server startup.

**Impact:**

This release improves the robustness and reliability of ConPort's database migrations and data handling. The updated documentation and automated Alembic provisioning make the server easier to set up and use, while the encoding fix ensures that data is handled consistently across different environments.

## Version 0.2.6 - Bug Fix Release

This release addresses a critical issue with Alembic database migrations that could occur when initializing ConPort in environments where a `context.db` file already existed, but without proper Alembic version tracking.

**Key Fix:**
- Modified the initial Alembic migration script (`068b7234d6a7_initial_database_schema.py`) to use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for the `product_context` and `active_context` tables. This prevents `sqlite3.OperationalError` when the tables are already present, ensuring smoother initialization and operation of the ConPort server.

**Impact:**
This fix improves the robustness of ConPort's database initialization process, particularly in scenarios involving partial or pre-existing database setups.

## ConPort v0.2.4 Update Notes

This release focuses on significant stability improvements, particularly around database management and migration, alongside enhanced data import capabilities.

### Key Changes and Bug Fixes:

#### 1. Robust Database Initialization and Migration (Alembic)
*   **Problem:** Persistent `alembic` migration failures, including `"No 'script_location' key found in configuration"` and `Can't locate revision` errors, which led to an inconsistent database state.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Refactored `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to ensure robust Alembic pathing and programmatic configuration of `script_location` and `sqlalchemy.url`.
    *   Introduced `ensure_alembic_files_exist` to reliably provision `alembic.ini` and the `alembic/` directory in the workspace, copying them from internal templates if missing. This ensures a consistent and correct Alembic environment for each workspace.
    *   Integrated this provisioning into `src/context_portal_mcp/main.py`'s `stdio` mode startup, guaranteeing that the Alembic environment is set up on server launch.
    *   Implemented a clean migration strategy that involves deleting the `context.db`, `alembic.ini`, and the `alembic/` directory to force a fresh, consistent migration when critical revision errors occur.

#### 2. Resolved Database Operation Errors
*   **Problem:** Recurrent `NameError: name 'cursor' is not defined` exceptions during database operations (e.g., `get_product_context`, `log_custom_data`), which prevented proper data interaction.
*   **Solution:** Modified all relevant database functions in `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to correctly initialize `cursor = None` and ensure `cursor.close()` is only called if `cursor` was successfully assigned, making database interactions more robust.

#### 3. Timestamp Column Schema Consistency
*   **Problem:** Inconsistent schema for `timestamp` columns in `system_patterns` and `custom_data` tables, leading to import failures and `AttributeError` exceptions.
*   **Solution:** Verified and resolved discrepancies in the database schema, ensuring that `timestamp` columns are correctly present and accessible in both `system_patterns` and `custom_data` tables. This involved identifying and removing redundant migration attempts.

#### 4. Enhanced Data Import Capabilities
*   **Problem:** Need to import existing ConPort data from various backup sources into a newly provisioned or migrated database.
*   **Solution:** Successfully implemented a two-phase data import strategy using `import_markdown_to_conport`, allowing for the consolidation of project data from multiple markdown export sources (e.g., `conport-export/` and `conport_migration_test_backup/`). This ensures that existing project context, decisions, progress, and custom data can be seamlessly integrated.

#### 5. General Stability and Reliability
*   Addressed various minor issues including `IndentationError`, `SyntaxError`, `pip.exe` missing from `uv venv`, incorrect `package-data` in `pyproject.toml`, ChromaDB `ValueError` for list metadata, and log file location issues.
*   Improved overall server startup and database connection handling.

### Upgrade Notes:
*   Users upgrading from previous versions are recommended to ensure their `alembic.ini` and `alembic/` directories in the workspace are correctly provisioned by starting the ConPort server. If issues persist, consider deleting `context.db`, `alembic.ini`, and the `alembic/` directory in your workspace to allow for a clean re-provisioning and migration.

## v0.1.3

**Release Notes Summary: Semantic Search & Enhanced Data Intelligence**

This version introduces a powerful semantic search capability to ConPort, along with a more intelligent data backend:

*   **New Semantic Search Tool (`semantic_search_conport`)**:
    *   Users can now search for ConPort items (Decisions, Progress, System Patterns, Custom Data, etc.) based on the semantic meaning of their query text, going beyond simple keyword matching.
    *   Supports advanced filtering by item type, tags (match all or any), and custom data categories to refine search results.

*   **Automatic Embedding Generation**:
    *   Key ConPort items (Decisions, Progress Entries, System Patterns, and text-based Custom Data) now automatically have embeddings generated and stored when they are logged.
    *   This powers the semantic search and enables future AI-driven insights.
    *   Utilizes the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for generating embeddings, ensuring consistency.

*   **Integrated Vector Store (ChromaDB)**:
    *   Embeddings are stored in a local ChromaDB vector database, managed per workspace within the `.conport_vector_data` directory.
    *   The system now explicitly configures ChromaDB to use the project's defined embedding model, enhancing consistency and reliability.

*   **Embedding Lifecycle Management**:
    *   Embeddings are now automatically removed from the vector store when their corresponding items (currently Decisions and System Patterns) are deleted from ConPort, keeping the search index synchronized.

These updates significantly enhance the ability to find relevant information within your ConPort workspace and lay the groundwork for more advanced contextual understanding features.
