          - **Specific Item Retrieval:** Use `get_custom_data` (if category/key known), `get_decisions` (by ID or for recent items), `get_system_patterns`, `get_progress` if the query points to specific item types or IDs.
          - **(Future):** Prioritize semantic search tools once available for conceptual queries.
          - **Broad Context (Fallback):** Use `get_product_context` or `get_active_context` as a fallback if targeted retrieval yields little, but be mindful of their size.
      - step: 3
        action: "Retrieve Initial Set"
        details: "Execute the chosen tool(s) to retrieve an initial, small set (e.g., top 3-5) of the most relevant items or data snippets."
      - step: 4
        action: "Contextual Expansion (Optional)"
        details: "For the most promising items from Step 3, consider using `get_linked_items` to fetch directly related items (1-hop). This can provide crucial context or disambiguation. Use judiciously to avoid excessive data."
      - step: 5
        action: "Synthesize and Filter"
        details: |
          Review the retrieved information (initial set + expanded context).
          - **Filter:** Discard irrelevant items or parts of items.
          - **Synthesize/Summarize:** If multiple relevant pieces of information are found, synthesize them into a concise summary that directly addresses the query/task. Extract only the most pertinent sentences or facts.
      - step: 6
        action: "Assemble Prompt Context"
        details: |
          Construct the context portion of the LLM prompt using the filtered and synthesized information.
          - **Clarity:** Clearly delineate this retrieved context from the user's query or other parts of the prompt.
          - **Attribution (Optional but Recommended):** If possible, briefly note the source of the information (e.g., "From Decision D-42:", "According to System Pattern SP-5:").
          - **Brevity:** Strive for relevance and conciseness. Avoid including large, unprocessed chunks of data unless absolutely necessary and directly requested.
    general_principles:
      - "Prefer targeted retrieval over broad context dumps."
      - "Iterate if initial retrieval is insufficient: try different keywords or tools."
      - "Balance context richness with prompt token limits."

  proactive_knowledge_graph_linking:
    description: |
      Guidance for the AI to proactively identify and suggest the creation of links between ConPort items,
      enriching the project's knowledge graph based on conversational context.
    trigger: "During ongoing conversation, when the AI observes potential relationships (e.g., causal, implementational, clarifying) between two or more discussed ConPort items or concepts that are likely represented as ConPort items."
    goal: "To actively build and maintain a rich, interconnected knowledge graph within ConPort by capturing relationships that might otherwise be missed."
    steps:
      - step: 1
        action: "Monitor Conversational Context"
        details: "Continuously analyze the user's statements and the flow of discussion for mentions of ConPort items (explicitly by ID, or implicitly by well-known names/summaries) and the relationships being described or implied between them."
      - step: 2
        action: "Identify Potential Links"
        details: |
          Look for patterns such as:
          - User states "Decision X led to us doing Y (which is Progress item P-3)."
          - User discusses how System Pattern SP-2 helps address a concern noted in Decision D-5.
          - User outlines a task (Progress P-10) that implements a specific feature detailed in a `custom_data` spec (CD-Spec-FeatureX).
      - step: 3
        action: "Formulate and Propose Link Suggestion"
        details: |
          If a potential link is identified:
          - Clearly state the items involved (e.g., "Decision D-5", "System Pattern SP-2").
          - Describe the perceived relationship (e.g., "It seems SP-2 addresses a concern in D-5.").
          - Propose creating a link using `ask_followup_question`.
          - Example Question: "I noticed we're discussing Decision D-5 and System Pattern SP-2. It sounds like SP-2 might 'address_concern_in' D-5. Would you like me to create this link in ConPort? You can also suggest a different relationship type."
          - Suggested Answers:
            - "Yes, link them with 'addresses_concern_in'."
            - "Yes, but use relationship type: [user types here]."
            - "No, don't link them now."
          - Offer common relationship types as examples if needed: 'implements', 'clarifies', 'related_to', 'depends_on', 'blocks', 'resolves', 'derived_from'.
      - step: 4
        action: "Gather Details and Execute Linking"
        details: |
          If the user confirms:
          - Ensure you have the correct source item type, source item ID, target item type, target item ID, and the agreed-upon relationship type.
          - Ask for an optional brief description for the link if the relationship isn't obvious.
          - Invoke the `link_conport_items` tool.
      - step: 5
        action: "Confirm Outcome"
        details: "Inform the user of the success or failure of the `link_conport_items` tool call."
    general_principles:
      - "Be helpful, not intrusive. If the user declines a suggestion, accept and move on."
      - "Prioritize clear, strong relationships over tenuous ones."
      - "This strategy complements the general `proactive_logging_cue` by providing specific guidance for link creation."

# --- Prompt Caching Strategies by Provider ---
prompt_caching_strategies:
  enabled: true
  core_mandate: |
    Actively seek opportunities to utilize prompt caching when interacting with the target LLM service.
    Primary goals: Reduce token costs and improve response latency.
    Leverage provider-specific caching mechanisms as defined below.
    - Notify user when structuring a prompt for potential caching: [INFO: Structuring prompt for caching]

  content_identification:
    description: |
      Criteria for identifying content from ConPort that is suitable for prompt caching.
      This content will form the stable prefix of prompts sent to the LLM.
    priorities:
      - item_type: "product_context"
        description: "Full text is a high-priority candidate if retrieved and relevant, due to size and relative stability."
      - item_type: "system_pattern"
        description: "Detailed descriptions of complex, frequently referenced patterns, especially if lengthy."
      - item_type: "custom_data"
        description: "Values from entries known/hinted to be large (e.g., specs, guides) or flagged with 'cache_hint: true' metadata."
      - item_type: "active_context"
        description: "Consider large, stable text blocks within active context if they will preface multiple queries *within the current task*."
    heuristics:
      min_token_threshold: 750
      stability_factor: "high"

  user_hints:
    description: |
      Users can provide explicit hints within ConPort item metadata to influence prompt caching decisions.
      These hints prioritize content for inclusion in the cacheable prompt prefix.
    retrieval_instruction: |
      When retrieving ConPort items that support metadata (e.g., `custom_data`), check the `metadata` field for the key `cache_hint`.
      If the `metadata` field is a JSON object and contains `"cache_hint": true`, consider the content of this item as a high-priority candidate for prompt caching, provided it also meets size and stability heuristics.
    logging_suggestion_instruction: |
      When logging or updating ConPort items (especially `custom_data`) that appear to be excellent caching candidates based on their size, stability, or likely reuse, you SHOULD suggest to the user adding a `cache_hint: true` flag to the item's `metadata` field.
      Confirm with the user before applying.
      Example suggestion: "This [Item Type, e.g., technical specification] seems large and stable, making it a good candidate for prompt caching. Would you like me to add `\"cache_hint\": true` to its metadata in ConPort to prioritize it?"

  strategy_note: |
    Storing cacheable content locally in ConPort and sending it as a prompt prefix at the start of each session avoids AI provider storage fees. However, this incurs the full input token cost for that content in every session and may increase initial latency compared to leveraging the provider's persistent caching with its discounted usage fees. The optimal approach depends on session frequency and content size. Provider-specific strategies below detail how to interact with their caching mechanisms.

  provider_specific_strategies:
    - provider_name: gemini_api
      description: Strategy for Google Gemini models (e.g., 1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash) which support implicit caching.
      interaction_protocol:
        type: "implicit"
        details: |
          Leverage Gemini's implicit caching by structuring prompts.
          1. Retrieve the stable, cacheable context from ConPort (based on identification rules).
          2. Place this retrieved ConPort text at the *absolute beginning* of the prompt sent to Gemini.
          3. Append any variable, task-specific parts (e.g., user's specific question, code snippets for analysis) *after* the stable prefix.
          Example: "[Retrieved Product Context Text] \n\n Now, answer this specific question: [User's Question]"
      staleness_management:
        details: |
          Be aware that ConPort data can be updated. Cached versions of that data in Gemini have a TTL.
          While direct invalidation isn't typically managed via implicit caching APIs, structuring prompts consistently helps Gemini manage its cache.
          If you know a core piece of ConPort context (like Product Context) has just been updated, the *next* prompt you send using that context *as a prefix* will naturally cause Gemini to process and potentially re-cache the new version.
    - provider_name: anthropic_api
      description: Strategy for Anthropic Claude models (e.g., 3.5 Sonnet, 3 Haiku, 3 Opus) which require explicit cache control.
      interaction_protocol:
        type: "explicit"
        details: |
          Utilize Anthropic's explicit prompt caching via `cache_control` breakpoints.
          1. Identify cacheable content from ConPort (based on identification rules and user hints).
          2. Construct the prompt message payload for the Anthropic API.
          3. Insert a `cache_control` breakpoint *after* the stable, cacheable content and *before* the variable content.
          Example (Conceptual API payload structure):
          {
            "messages": [
              {"role": "user", "content": "[Stable ConPort Content]"},
              {"role": "user", "content": {"type": "tool_code", "text": "<cache_control>{\"type\": \"set_cache_break\"}</cache_control>"}},
              {"role": "user", "content": "[Variable User Query]"}
            ],
            ...
          }
          (Note: The exact syntax for `cache_control` may vary; refer to Anthropic API docs.)
      staleness_management:
        details: |
          Anthropic's explicit caching may offer more control over invalidation or TTL, but details need confirmation from their API documentation.
          If ConPort data is updated, ensure subsequent prompts use the updated content, which should trigger re-caching or correct handling by the Anthropic API based on its specific rules.
    - provider_name: openai_api
      description: Strategy for OpenAI models with automatic prompt caching.
      interaction_protocol:
        type: "implicit"
        details: |
          Leverage OpenAI's automatic prompt caching by structuring prompts.
          This is similar to Gemini's implicit caching and requires no explicit markers.
          1. Identify cacheable content from ConPort (based on identification rules and user hints).
          2. Place this retrieved ConPort text at the *absolute beginning* of the prompt sent to the OpenAI API.
          3. Append any variable, task-specific parts *after* the stable prefix.
          OpenAI provides a 50% discount on cached input tokens. Caching automatically activates for prompts over a certain length (e.g., >1024 tokens, but verify current documentation).
      staleness_management:
        details: |
          Automatic caching handles staleness implicitly. If prompt prefix changes (e.g., updated ConPort data), OpenAI processes/re-caches new prefix.
